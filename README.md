# HTML-CSS-Code-Refactor

## Description 

My motivation for this work was to refactor Horiseon Social Solution Services existing marketing site. 

The main aim of the refactor was to make the site more accessible ensuring that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Refactoring the accessibility will also help the sites search engine's optimization.

The refactoring I have done on the site will give better accessibility to anyone with disabilities that use aids to help then use the internet. It also solves greater accessibility via long-term sustainability implemented, I achieved this by making sure all existing links are functioning correctly, reworking the existing CSS by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, arranging correct semantic structure of the HTML elements, and finally breaking the code down into readable section by including comment lines before each element or section of the page.

This project was great to work on, I learned the key importance of making sites accessible for all, and the importance of helping companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website with ease. It taught me the key steps to take when getting rid of redundant code, making sure HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning and leaving the code easier to read for the next person via sectioning and commentary.
