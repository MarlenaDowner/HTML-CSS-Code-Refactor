# HTML-CSS-Code-Refactor

## Description 

My motivation for this work was to refactor Horiseon Social Solution Services existing marketing site. 

The main aim of the refactor was to make the site more accessible ensuring that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Refactoring the accessibility will also help the sites search engine's optimization.

The refactoring I have done on the site will give better accessibility to anyone with disabilities that use aids to help then use the internet. It also solves greater accessibility via long-term sustainability implemented, I achieved this by making sure all existing links are functioning correctly, reworking the existing CSS by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, arranging correct semantic structure of the HTML elements, and finally breaking the code down into readable section by including comment lines before each element or section of the page.

This project was great to work on, I learned the key importance of making sites accessible for all, and the importance of helping companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website with ease. It taught me the key steps to take when getting rid of redundant code, making sure HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning and leaving the code easier to read for the next person via sectioning and commentary.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
